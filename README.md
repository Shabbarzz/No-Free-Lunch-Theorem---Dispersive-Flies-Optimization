# No-Free-Lunch-Theorem---Dispersive-Flies-Optimization
Dispersive Flies Optimisation, or DFO for short, is inspired by flies swarming behaviour over food sources.
Swarms of flies may comprise of a single fly, to thousands or countless millions, depending on the species. When disturbed, swarms of flies disperse and then regather, which is summarises the behaviour of the algorithm, the formation and then weakening of the swarms.
